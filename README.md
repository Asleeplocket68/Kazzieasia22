<h1>Hi there</h1>
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
  
  I am Keenan Asia, A developer (specializing in backend web development) pursuing my Bachelors in Coding
  
  I am really enthusiastic about learning new codes. From 2016 - 2018, I learnt simple html like styling a webpage as well as  checking out the fonts. there was a opportunity to do javascript in that timeframe. In 2022 till now, I learnt SQL  databases, php, AJAX and some CSS styling. I also got started with freelancing.
  
  Outside the world of coding too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from guitar electric and accoustic,  singing, bass and playing drums (guitar and bass are two different instruments). The aim is to master guitar and bass.
  
  I love watching videos of people who create different type of codes or uses different types of codes just to fix the problem that they experience. There are loads of channels on youtube that helps everyone and it definitely helpes me with certain problems (check this link out https://youtu.be/q4WiBVAbNw4. Like and subscribe).
  
  I love playing video games as well, even though I dont have a computer. I'll use my phone if a computer is not within reach.
